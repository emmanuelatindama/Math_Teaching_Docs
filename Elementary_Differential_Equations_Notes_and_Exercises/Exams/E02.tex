  A loading platform of mass \(m=10 \si{kg}\) that can move only along a vertical axis is supported by:
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item  a spring of undetermined spring constant \(k\), and
    \item a damper whose force is proportional to the speed at which it is being stretched or compressed with constant of proportionality \(c = 20 \si{N}\si{s}/\si{m}\).
  \end{compactitem}
   Take gravitational acceleration to be \(g \approx 10 \si{m}\si{s}^{-2}\).

  \begin{compactenum}[(a)]
    \item Determine the ODE for this mechanical system with undetermined \(k\). As needed, use free-body diagrams, force balance, etc.
    \item Calculate the value of \(k\) if you know that the platform sits at \(x_{EQ} = 1 \si{m}\) in the equilibrium (static) state.
    \item \marginnote{  In all cases, use \textbf{real basis} (sines, cosines, etc.) where appropriate. } Calculate the general solution for the motion of the platform.
    \item Sketch the solution \(x(t)\) that you calculated under (c) for an arbitrary non-equilibrium initial condition. Make sure your sketch demonstrates at least
      \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
        \item presence/absence of oscillations,
        \item growth/decay of the amplitude, and 
        \item the limit as \(t\to\infty\).

    Explain: \textbf{What is resonance}, from physical and mathematical standpoints.

    \vspace{2in}

    What are the possible values of \(k\) in the equation below that result in resonance (\textbf{show your work}):
    \[
      2 \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + 4 k x(t) = \sin(2t) + e^{3t}
    \]

    \vfill

    Form the \textbf{candidate for the forced solution} for the resonant case (that is, when \(k\) is set to the value in which resonance occurs). Show your work. (No need to find values of the coefficients, leave them as \(A,B,C,\dots\), just forming the candidate is enough.)
